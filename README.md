Implementation of the A* algorithm in Artificial Intelligence

A* Algorithm is a Heuristic Search Algorithm which forms the basis of some real time algorithms such as Real Time A* and Learning Real Time A*. In this algorithm, the best path is chosen from the starting node to the goal node, based on the heuristic 
                                              ## f*(n) = g*(n) + h*(n)
Here g*(n) is the shortest distance from the starting node to the current node and h*(n) is the minimum distance from the current node to the goal node. The node with the minimum value of f* is chosen every time. 

This algorithm is complete, optimal as well as admissible.

In this project, a simple implementation of a dynamic route planner is given which uses A* algorithm to find the optimal path.
